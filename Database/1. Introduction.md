# Introduction

## Drawbacks of using file systems to store data

1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
2. Difficulty in accessing data
3. Data isolation
4. Integrity problems
5. Atomicity of updates
6. Concurrent access by multiple users
7. Security problems

**Database systems offer solutions to all the above problems.**

## Schemas and Instances
### Schema
The logical structure of the database.

### Instance
The actual content of the database at a particular time point.

### Data Independence
The ability to modify the physical schema without changing the logical schema and vice versa.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Language for accessing and manipulating the data organized by the appropriate data model. It is also known as query language.

### Procedural
User specifies what data is required and how to get those data.

### Declarative (non-procedural)
User specifies what data is required without specifying how to get those data.

SQL is a widely used non-procedural language.

## Data Definition Language (DDL)
Specification notation for defining the database schema.

```
create table instructor (
    ID char(5), 
    name varchar(20),
    dept_name varchar(20),
    salary numeric(8,2))
```

DDL compiler generates a set of table templates stored in a data dictionary.

Data dictionary contains metadata, i.e.,
1. Database schema
2. Integrity constraints (primary key, referential integrity)
3. Authorization
