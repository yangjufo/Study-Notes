# Relation Model

Formally, given sets <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D_1, D_2, ... D_n"> a relation r is a subset of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D_1 \times D_2 \times ... \times D_n">. Thus, a relation is a set of n-tuples (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, â€¦, a<sub>n</sub>) where each <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a_i \in D_i">

## Attribute (Column)
### Domain
The set of allowed values for ech attribute is called teh domain of the attribute.
`null` is a member of every domain.

## Relation Instance
### Tuple
An element `t` of `r` is a tuple, represented by a row in a table

## Keys
### Super Key
`K` is a superkey of `R` if values for `K` are sufficient to identify a unique tuple of each possible relation `r(R)`.

### Candidate Key
Super key `K` is a candidate key if `K` is minimal.

### Primary Key
One of the candidate keys is selected to be the primary key.

### Foreign Key
Value in one relation must appear in another.
